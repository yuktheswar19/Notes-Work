1 ) Removed null values 
2 ) cleaned the data
3 ) FInd correlations 
4 ) Then Feature Engineering 
5 ) Factor the categorical values
6 ) find Relations based on the features available 
7 ) Plot the features 



TO DO 

1 )  Have to make desicion on which model to use for training 
2 )  Need to study the model of why and on how to apply to the project

Here are all the features from your dataset explained in simple terms, each in one line:

- **AGE:** Age of the patient in years.
- **PackHistory:** Total number of cigarette packs smoked per year.
- **MWT1Best:** Best distance (in meters) walked during the 6-minute walk test.
- **FEV1:** Volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced breath (liters).
- **FVC:** Total volume of air exhaled during a forced breath (liters).
- **CAT:** COPD Assessment Test score, measuring impact of COPD on health.
- **HAD:** Hospital Anxiety and Depression score.
- **SGRQ:** St. Georgeâ€™s Respiratory Questionnaire score, measuring health status and quality of life in respiratory disease.
- **AGEquartiles:** Age group of the patient divided into quartiles (1 to 4).
- **gender:** Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male).
- **smoking:** Smoking status (0 = never, 1 = current, 2 = former smoker).
- **Diabetes:** Whether the patient has diabetes (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **muscular:** Whether the patient has muscular disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **hypertension:** Whether the patient has high blood pressure (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **AtrialFib:** Whether the patient has atrial fibrillation (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **IHD:** Whether the patient has ischemic heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **COPDSEVERITY:** Severity of COPD (MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, VERY SEVERE).
- **FEV1_FVC_Ratio:** Ratio of FEV1 to FVC, a key lung function indicator.
- **Lung_Efficiency_Index:** Calculated index representing lung efficiency.
