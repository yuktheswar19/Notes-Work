## If statement 
If statement works , only if a certain condition is true 
```python
age = 20

if age > 18 :
	print("your are barely old")
```

## else statement 
else statement will only execute on , when **"If statement"** is false . It will jump to the else logic when if statement is false 

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18 :
	print("you are allowed")

else:
	print("you are not old enough")
```

## elif statement
