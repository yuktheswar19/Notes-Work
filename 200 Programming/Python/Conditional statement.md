## If statement 
If statement works , only if a certain condition is true 
```python
age = 20

if age > 18 :
	print("your are barely old")
```

## else statement 
else statement will only execute on , when **"If statement"** is false . It will jump to the else logic when if statement is false 

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18 :
	print("you are allowed")

else:
	print("you are not old enough")
```

## elif statement

elif statement will help you to check multiple logic statements . It stands for "else if"

```python

age = 18

if age > 18:
	print("you are an adult")

elif age == 18:
	print("barely an adult")

else :
	print("you are still a minor")
```

## Nested Conditional Statements 

You can place one or more if , elif statement inside another if , elif  or else statement to create a nested if
