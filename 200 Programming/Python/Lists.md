Lists are ordered mutable collection of items, such as words or numbers, written or stored together in an ordered or organized way. Lists can be used to group related information for easy reference or use, like a shopping list or a to-do list. In programming, a list is a data structure that holds an ordered and changeable collection of items, which may include duplicates and can be of different types

```python
list = []
print(type(list))
```

Lists are always mentioned in [ ]

## Indexing
To access elements in a list, use the index number of the element inside square brackets []. The index starts at 0 for the first element. For example:

```python
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(mylist[0])  # Output: apple - first element
print(mylist[1])  # Output: banana - second element
print(mylist[-1]) # Output: cherry - last element (negative index)
```
