Arrays are collection of items in a list 

2 Types of arrays 

1) Static array 
2) Dynamic Array 


### Time complexity of Accessing arrays 
| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Lookup    | O(1)            |
| Push      | O(1)            |
| Insert    | O(n)            |
| Delete    | O(n)            |

**Note -  Push can be O(n) as well** 
	if it is not a static array and if you need to push few more items , It should be O(n)
