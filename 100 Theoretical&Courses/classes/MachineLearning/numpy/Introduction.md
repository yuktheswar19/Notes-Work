NumPy is an open-source Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to efficiently operate on these arrays. NumPy is faster and more memory-efficient than regular Python lists for numerical data and is widely used in data science, engineering, and scientific fields


## Numpy uses arrays 

arrays are the primary use for numpy for homogeneous calculations , they can  be used for preferred tasks like scientific computing . image processing or when performing repeated calculations 

- To access a particular element in an array , it know where to jump to and how number of bits it needs to just 

**Example** :
```python
x = [ 1,2,3 ]
```

Taking this example of 3 elements and there
