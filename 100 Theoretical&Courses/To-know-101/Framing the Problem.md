## Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture

- **Define the objective in business terms.**
- **How will your solution be used?**
- **What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?**
- **How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?**
- **How should performance be measured?**
- **Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?** 
- **What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?**
- **What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?**
- **Is human expertise available?**
- **How would you solve the problem manually?**
- **List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.**
- **Verify assumptions if possible**


## Get the Data

- **List the data you need and how much you need.**
- **Find and document where you can get that data.**
- **Check how much space it will take.**
- **Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary.**
- **Get access authorizations.**
- **Create a workspace (with enough storage space).** 
- **Get the data**.

	- What kind of insights and data do i need to capture and track the key metrics

- Step 3 - **( Collect and preparing the data )**
	- Where can i find the data
	- are there data quality issues 
	- will i need to transform the data to support the analysis 

- Step 4 - **( Analyse and explore the data )**
	- Which views of the data can help support my analysis 
	- What types of patterns and trends are emerging 
	- Are there actionable insights that could help drive success outcomes 

- Step 5 - **( Communicate Findings )**
	- How can i craft narrative to clearly summarise the analysis
