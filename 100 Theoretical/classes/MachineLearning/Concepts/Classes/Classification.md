# **What is Classification**

**Classification** is a machine learning technique used to identify the **category** or class of new observations based on training data. The goal is to assign labels to input data based on learned patterns.

## **Types of Classification Algorithms**

- Logistic Regression    
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost)
- Neural Networks
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)


## **Algorithms**

## **Logistic Regression**

- **Logistic Regression** is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability that an input belongs to a particular class (e.g., "yes" or "no", "spam" or "not spam") by applying the logistic (sigmoid) function, which maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1.

- **How it works:**  Logistic regression models the relationship between the input features and the probability of a particular outcome. If the predicted probability is above a certain threshold (commonly 0.5), the input is classified into one class; otherwise, into the other.

- **Example:**  Suppose you want to predict whether a student will pass an exam (yes/no) based on the number of hours they studied. Logistic regression can model the relationship between "hours studied" and the probability of passing. If the predicted probability is above 0.5, the model classifies the student as "will pass"; otherwise, "will not pass"



## **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a model. In machine learning, MLE finds the parameter values that make the observed data most probable under the model.

- **In other words:**  MLE chooses the parameters that maximize the likelihood function, which measures how likely it is to observe your actual data given a particular set of model parameters
